  - set up with GitHub's [[https://github.com/github/scripts-to-rule-them-all][Scripts to Rule Them All]]


* Notes

** [2020-06-24 Wed]

   had similar issue with importing emacs stuff

** [2020-06-22 Mon]

   ran into issues getting dotdrop working still

   - had to run dotdrop in verbose mode and see what was going on
   - some of the diffs were just not being generated

** merging emacs config into dotfiles

*** adding git repo into another and preserving history

    #+begin_src shell
      git remote add emacsd_remote git@github.com:r-medina/.emacs.d.git
      git fetch emacsd_remote
      git merge -s ours --no-commit --allow-unrelated-histories emacsd_remote/master
      git read-tree --prefix=dotfiles/emacs.d -u emacsd_remote/master
      git commit -m "imported .emacs.d as a subtree"
      git remote rm emacsd_remote
      git push
    #+end_src

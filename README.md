# dotfiles

## Notes:

- trying to follow GitHub's [scripts to rule them all](https://github.com/github/scripts-to-rule-them-all)
- getting started by jacking [@acourtneybrown](https://github.com/acourtneybrown/dotfiles)'s dotfiles
- [vagrant setup](https://www.vagrantup.com/intro/getting-started/)
- local files are in `/vagrant`
- considering getting rid of emacs config and just using tramp
